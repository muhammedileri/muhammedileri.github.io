I am a PhD student in the [Department of Linguistics](https://www.ling.upenn.edu) at the University of Pennsylvania. My advisor is [David Embick](https://www.ling.upenn.edu/~embick/), and I am affiliated with the [Embick Lab](https://web.sas.upenn.edu/embick-lab/) and the [Penn Syntax Lab](https://web.sas.upenn.edu/syntax-lab/). My interests lie at the intersection of syntax, morphology, and phonology. Specifically, a major focus of my research is understanding the role of morphology as a mediator between syntax and phonology. Besides my interest in the architecture of grammar, I am also interested in the learnability and productivity of (morpho-)phonological rules. Much of my work examines morphophonological rules and exceptions, as well as inflectional defectiveness and (non-)suppletive allomorphy in Turkish and other Turkic languages. You can find my CV [here](https://github.com/muhammedileri/muhammedileri.github.io/blob/master/files/CV_muhammedileri.pdf?raw=true).
