I am a PhD student at the [Department of Linguistics](https://www.ling.upenn.edu) at the University of Pennsylvania. My interests lie at the intersection of syntax, morphology, and phonology. Specifically, a major focus of my research is understanding the role of morphology as a mediator between syntax and phonology. Besides my interest in the architecture of grammar, I am also interested in the learnability and productivity of (morpho-)phonological rules. I mostly work on phenomena such as inflectional defectiveness and suppletive/non-suppletive allomorphy in Turkish (and some other Turkic languages).
